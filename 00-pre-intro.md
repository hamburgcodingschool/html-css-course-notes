# How to start

## Setup

Before we even start to learn any of the techniques that web sites use to show us pretty pictures and stuff we need to get our setup running.

Don't worry, it's easy.

- create a file in you OsX finder or microsoft explorer
- call it `index.html`
- double click or open in you favorite web browser

That's it. You have your very first web site in your browser. Not very much to see here but technically this is all you need.

## Editors

To edit your site and add content to it you need a text editor. Theoretically any editor will be fine but there are some editor that where created with WebDevelopment (or programming) in mind.

These are the popular one at the time of writing:

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Atom Editor](https://atom.io/)
- [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
- [Brackets](http://brackets.io/)

I can recommend Visual Studio Code. It's the one i use for my daily work. But all the editors have basically the same features. Choose the one you like best, switch between them regularly when you get angry at you current one. It is import that you use the one that you most comfortable in. In the editor you will spend most of you time. They are all free to download and use.

## Browser

Now a few words about the browser we want to use. The browser is maybe even more important to a developer than the editor because good browsers help developers to their work better.

The top notch browsers to do web devloper work in today are probably [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/). Although there are more browsers on the market these two are the big ones now. They come with awesome developer tools we will need to find errors and test out things.

## Others

There is no other. You've heard about servers and domains and such? This all fine but to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript we do not need any more infrastructure. Since HTML files, and CSS and JavaScript files for that matter, are pure text documents that a browser reads we can work on our computer. The browser just gets a file which contains a HTML document and we are ready to build our awesome website and learn about all the techniques we can use. Nothing else is happening on the world wide web. Only that our browser reads a file that a server _serves_ to us. But a server is nothing else as someone elses computer.
